# BoxCar
DIY RC car project, although it is actually controlled via SSH'ing into the RaspberryPi.


To-Do list:
* Establish which motors, and figure out how to control them (stepper, or DC?)
* Finalize frame of car, and secure motors/boards into place
* Create node.js web app to control the car with? (Using SSH for now)
* Create GUI to control the car with? (Java this time? So it's cross platform)
* Add camera/sensors to car - autonomous? - add catapult?
